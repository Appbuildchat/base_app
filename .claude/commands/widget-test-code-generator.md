# Widget Test Code Generator

Generates comprehensive Flutter widget tests for domain-specific features based on test file lists.

For the specified domain test file:
1. Read the test file list requirements carefully
2. Use @widget-test/widget-test-planner to create detailed test implementation plan
3. Review plan at `/plans/widget-test-{domain}/plan.md`
4. Implement ALL test files exactly as planned (NO OMISSIONS)
5. Verify implementation completeness against original list
6. Document completion in `/plans/widget-test-{domain}/completed.md`
