## 1. Business & Product Overview

### Business Idea Summary
This mobile app motivates adults and college students to improve their health through daily walking. It tracks users’ steps using smartphone sensors, calculates calorie burn based on personal data and scientific formulas, and rewards users with points for reaching step milestones. Points can be redeemed for healthy products (e.g., vitamins, supplements) curated and managed by administrators. The app features a premium, dark-themed design for a luxurious user experience.

### Problem & Solution
**Problem:**  
Many people struggle to maintain consistent physical activity and make healthy lifestyle choices due to lack of motivation and accessible, trustworthy rewards.

**Solution:**  
The app incentivizes daily walking by awarding points for step milestones, which can be redeemed for high-quality, nutritionist-approved products. This unique approach combines health management with tangible, non-monetary rewards, encouraging users to build lasting healthy habits.

### Target Audience
- Adults and college students seeking to improve their health and fitness.
- Users motivated by tangible rewards and interested in nutrition and wellness.
- Individuals who prefer a premium, visually comfortable app experience.

**Pain Points:**
- Difficulty staying motivated to walk regularly.
- Lack of trustworthy, accessible healthy rewards.
- Desire for accurate, science-based health tracking.

### Unique Value Proposition
- Users can only earn rewards by walking—products cannot be purchased with money, only with points earned from physical activity.
- All products are curated and verified by a food science and nutrition expert, ensuring quality and reliability.
- The app features a luxurious, dark-themed design for a comfortable and premium user experience.
