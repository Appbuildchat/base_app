# Feature-Based UX Guidelines

This project now uses a **feature-based documentation system** for UX guidelines. Instead of having all guidelines in one file, each feature has its own dedicated documentation.

## How to Find Feature Guidelines

For specific feature guidelines, check the corresponding `.md` file in the `@docs/feature/` directory:

### Examples:
- **Chat functionality** → Check `@docs/feature/chat.md`
- **Marketplace/E-commerce** → Check `@docs/feature/marketplace.md`
- **Post/Content Management** → Check `@docs/feature/post.md`
- **Community features** → Check `@docs/feature/community.md`

## Benefits of This Approach

- **Modular**: Each feature is documented separately for easier maintenance
- **Organized**: Find exactly what you need without scrolling through unrelated content
- **Scalable**: Easy to add new features or update existing ones
- **Focused**: Each file contains specific, actionable guidelines for that feature

## Getting Started

1. Identify the feature you're working on
2. Navigate to `@docs/feature/[feature-name].md`
3. Follow the specific UX guidelines for that feature
4. If a feature file doesn't exist yet, create it following the established patterns

*This modular approach ensures that UX guidelines remain organized and easily accessible as the project grows.*
